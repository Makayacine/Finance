üìù Project Overview
This project provides a comprehensive quantitative analysis of five major South African bank stocks listed on the JSE: Standard Bank (SBK.JO), FirstRand (FSR.JO), Nedbank (NED.JO), Absa Group (ABG.JO), and Capitec (CPI.JO). The analysis covers data acquisition, exploratory data analysis (EDA) including statistical and visual insights, and the backtesting of classical technical trading strategies. A key focus is on understanding return distributions, assessing risk metrics, and evaluating strategy performance with the crucial inclusion of transaction costs.

The notebook is designed to be a clear, step-by-step narrative, making the complex financial analysis accessible and easy to follow.

üéØ Objectives
Our primary goals for this analysis are:

üìä Data Acquisition & Cleaning:

Download 10 years of historical stock data (Close prices and Volume) from Yahoo Finance.

Perform robust cleaning to handle missing values, spurious zeros/negatives, and extreme outliers.

üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyze daily return distributions (mean, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis).

Perform Jarque-Bera normality tests to understand the shape of return distributions.

Visualize return distributions using histograms and QQ-plots.

Compute and visualize the correlation matrix between bank stock returns.

Calculate key risk metrics: Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR), and Annualized Sharpe Ratios.

üìà Strategy Backtesting:

Implement and backtest two classical technical trading strategies:

Moving Average (MA) Crossover (7-day / 21-day): A trend-following strategy.

Bollinger Bands (20-day, ¬±2œÉ): A mean-reversion strategy.

Evaluate strategy performance using metrics such as total return, annualized return, annualized volatility, Sharpe Ratio, and Maximum Drawdown.

Crucially, incorporate realistic transaction costs (0.10% per round-trip trade) into all strategy performance calculations for a practical assessment.

‚öñÔ∏è Performance Comparison: Compare the performance of the active trading strategies against a passive Buy & Hold benchmark.

‚úÖ Key Findings & Conclusions
Capitec's Remarkable Outperformance: Capitec consistently demonstrated a unique profile with significantly higher annualized mean returns and the only positive Sharpe Ratio under a Buy & Hold strategy. Its high kurtosis indicates frequent extreme movements, but its returns historically compensated for this risk. It also showed lower correlation with other banks, suggesting diversification benefits.

Active Strategies Generally Underperformed: Both the Moving Average Crossover and Bollinger Bands strategies generally failed to outperform the Buy & Hold benchmark for most banks, especially after accounting for transaction costs.

The MA Crossover often resulted in substantial negative net returns and Sharpe Ratios, indicating it's not well-suited for these assets or market conditions with the chosen parameters.

The Bollinger Bands strategy, while sometimes better than MA, also struggled to generate consistent positive risk-adjusted returns after transaction costs.

Critical Impact of Transaction Costs: The analysis vividly highlights how even a small transaction cost (0.10%) can severely erode profitability, turning theoretically positive returns into negative net results. This underscores the necessity of robust strategies with high win rates and/or low trading frequency to overcome real-world trading expenses.

Non-Normal Returns & Tail Risk: The Jarque-Bera tests and QQ-plots confirmed that the daily returns for all bank stocks are not normally distributed, exhibiting "fat tails." This emphasizes the importance of using risk metrics like CVaR, which provide a more conservative view of potential losses in extreme market conditions.
